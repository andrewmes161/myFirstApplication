This is an inventory app that I create for a college  project

For this assignment, our class was tasked with creating a basic inventory app using android studio. User's had to be able to login or create a new user. Once verified, the user was able to store, and update info on a basic inventory in a list format. The app need to use SQLite to store the data locally on the phone. UI need to be clean. The theme had to be uniform throughout the applictation. Buttons and text fields had to be used to to prompt user input and verifications. 

My application consisted of two layouts. One for the initial login, and the second one for the inventory management. As far as the overall development. My process was fairly simple, design the layout first. Then setup the finer detailed code after the "foundation" was created. This way, everything would be accounted for before a large protion of the programming was implemented. I found this approach helpful because it focused on the overall user experience, and then the implementation of the structure later. This ment that I was able to get a good grasp what the user needed as well as rapidly make changes to the UI if nessessary.

Code testing was done using JUNIT testing, and UI was screened using a mixture of Toast functions and Log.d() statements to ensure that buttons and functions where working correctly. 

My favorite part of the project had to be CRUD implementation and setting up the database behind the application. I have no idea why, but I find it awesome to get an application to log and save data, and then pull up that same data running the application again. I feel that this is where the fun begins in an application, and you really get to see how powerful a program can become.
